# Sentiment Analysis ProjectðŸ“–ðŸš€

This is a **basic Sentiment Analysis** project that classifies text as **positive** or **negative** using **NaÃ¯ve Bayes** and **Random Forest**. The goal is to explore and improve text classification techniques over time.

## Features
- Classifies text into **positive** or **negative** sentiment
- Uses **NaÃ¯ve Bayes** and **Random Forest** classifiers
- Simple **text preprocessing** (tokenization, stopwords removal, Bag of Words)
- Random Forest performed better than NaÃ¯ve Bayes
- Expandable for future improvements and additional features

## Data

The dataset used for this project is the IMDB Dataset of Top 1000 Movies and TV Shows. It contains movie and TV show details, which were used for sentiment classification.
