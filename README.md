# Sentiment Analysis ProjectðŸ“–ðŸš€

This is a **basic Sentiment Analysis** project that classifies text as **positive** or **negative** using **NaÃ¯ve Bayes** and **Random Forest**. The goal is to explore and improve text classification techniques over time.

## Features
- Classifies text into **positive** or **negative** sentiment
- Uses **NaÃ¯ve Bayes** and **Random Forest** classifiers
- Simple **text preprocessing** (tokenization, stopwords removal, Bag of Words)
- Random Forest performed better than NaÃ¯ve Bayes
- Expandable for future improvements and additional features

## Installation
Clone the repository:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/Vidushi2709/Sentiment_analysis.git

````

## Future Improvements
- Implement **TF-IDF** to see if accuracy improves
- Experiment with **transformers** for better performance
- Expand dataset for better accuracy
- Add a user-friendly web interface
